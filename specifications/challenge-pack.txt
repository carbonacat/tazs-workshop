  - @     +10: means 10 bytes after the beginning of the block.
  - @ ADDRESS: means at ADDRESS bytes after the beginning of the file.
  - @ +OFFSET: means at OFFSET bytes after the beginning of the current block.
- Types:
  - zstring - Null-terminated string.
  - uint16 - Unsigned integer of 2 bytes.
  - int8 - Signed integer of 1 byte.
  - uint8 - Unsigned integer of 1 byte.
  - <BLOCK> - Block described by the <BLOCK> STRUCTURE section.

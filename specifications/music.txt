DESCRIPTION

This file describe the binary structure of a Music in TAZS.
A Music are represented by a single instrument, and a sequence of Events, most of which are Notes.


INFOS

- Null characters are represented by [NULL].
- Constants strings are represented with "". If null-terminated, they must show the null character.
- Addresses are using decimal numbers.
  - @      10: means 0 from the beginning of the file.
  - @     +10: means 10 bytes after the beginning of the block.
  - @ ADDRESS: means at ADDRESS bytes after the beginning of the file.
  - @ +OFFSET: means at OFFSET bytes after the beginning of the current block.
- Types:
  - zstring - Null-terminated string.
  - uint16 - Unsigned integer of 2 bytes.
  - int8 - Signed integer of 1 byte.
  - uint8 - Unsigned integer of 1 byte.
  - <BLOCK> - Block described by the <BLOCK> STRUCTURE section.
  - [End] - End of the block or the file.
- Durations for the instrument are expressed in 8000th of second.
- Durations for the events are expressed in 16th of second.


FILE STRUCTURE

- @                           0: zstring - `TAZS-MUSICALO-1[NULL]` - Constant.
- @                          16: uint16 - TITLE_ADDR - The address to the first character of the Music's Title.
- @                          18: uint16 - INSTR_ADD - The address to the Instrument part of the Music.
- @                          20: uint16 - EVENTS_ADDR - The address to the Events part of the Pack.
- @                          22: uint16 - EXTRA_ADDR - The address to the Extra part of the Pack.
- @                  TITLE_ADDR: zstring - The Pack's Title.
- @                   INSTR_ADD: <INSTRUMENT>
- @                 EVENTS_ADDR: uint16 - EVENTS_COUNT - Number of Events inside this pack.
- @               EVENTS_ADDR+2: <EVENT> * EVENTS_COUNT - The Events.
- @                  EXTRA_ADDR: [End]


<INSTRUMENT> STRUCTURE

- @                           0: uint16 - ATTACK_DURATION - How much time the Attack phase will last, in 8000th of second.
- @                           2: uint16 - DECAY_DURATION - How much time the Decay phase will last, in 8000th of second.
- @                           4: uint16 - RELEASE_DURATION - How much time the Release phase will last, in 8000th of second.
- @                           6: uint8 - SUSTAIN_MAX_RATIO - The amplitude of the Max/Sustain, in 256th.


<EVENT> STRUCTURE
- @                          +0: <COMMAND>
- @                          +1: DURATION - How long this event will last, in 16th of second.
- @                          +2: LOUDNESS - How loud this event is. 64 is the maximum, and very loud.

<COMMAND> STRUCTURE

Values:
- -128 - Go to location
  - DURATION and LOUDNESS will be added together to know where to jump.
- From -36 to +36 - Note.
  - The value is interpreted as the Note's Pitch.
  - 0 is DO at 523.25 Hz.
  - Multiples of 12, including 0, is a DO/C.

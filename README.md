# Totally Accurate Zombie Simulator - Workshop

It's a satellite repository for the main project ( https://github.com/carbonacat/tazs-javitto )
It contains the sources for most of the Audio and Graphics files used in that project.

## Structure

Admittingly, it's not as clean as the main repository. I'm sorry for that.

Root - All the sources for the graphics (sprites, etc) files.
- `renders` - The rendered files ready to be copied into the main project.
- `sounds` - The sounds.
- `specifications` - Contains the specifications for some of the binary formats used in the main project.
